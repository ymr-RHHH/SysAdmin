# Shell

- Shell is a command line interface (CLI) . 

  It's how you interact with the computer. And what you normally use everyday is called GUI (graphical user interface). These are just different ways for people to inter with a machine.

  In fact, the command line or terminal are used to be the original way for the old time people in mainframe eras where people had massive computer or supercomputers actually interacted with computer.  

- Common shells : Bash, zsh, fish ......

  These are just different versions of the shell. They're mostly the same. Each one has some nuances and some differences to it.

  Fish is friendly, but when we learn Linux, we just stick to the default one is OK, because in this course like 99 percent of use cases, their differences should not matter.

  In the world of open source, **popularity is everything**. So the more popular you project gets, more people are going to use it and then it will become the standard. **Bash is the standard**, because it's the most popular shell. By default, almost every Linux distro uses Bash. 

## Shell commands

- Basic structure

  **`[command] [flags] [arguments]`**

  - You should better to RTFM `man [command]`

    In this command, you can get a manual page of what the command is supposed to do. It's usually give you a synopsis of the general things that it does and the flags that you can pass in and what it expects as arguments. 

    **Don't for a second even think we all know these commands by heart, it's impossible!** This is not true in your life or like in this course in general. You'll always be constantly looking things up --- either at the `man` page or on Google. Looking things up is always increased and is completely fine! This is not a test of memorization, **it's just you getting used to things**. 

  - Google is a good friend

## Common Shell Commands

## Editors

When you working on the terminal, in principle, almost anything that you can do in Linux. 

In the most part, it's going to be dealing with text files. And files are like the root of everything in Linux or just in general. So using an Editor is a very common aspect of interacting with the terminal itself. 

Normal Editors:

-  Nano

- Vim

  This is the god of Editors. It can makes your life a lot more faster! But it's difficult to learn.

  And it's my favorite Editors! It's VERY COOL!!! It can be customized!!!

- Emacs

- VScode
